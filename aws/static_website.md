Steps to Host a Static Website on AWS (with Explanation)



Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance

    What you do:
        - Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Launch Instance
        - Choose Ubuntu Server
        - Select t2.micro or t3.micro (if it is free trial)
        - Create/download a .pem key
        - Open ports:
            -22 (SSH)
            -80 (HTTP)
        - Click launch instance
        
        copy the example path from ssh client

    Why
        -EC2 provides a virtual server
        -Security Group allows browser and SSH access

Step 2: Connect to EC2 using SSH
        - Go to the file where ssh.pm file is present
        - open terminal  
        - add the shh code which we had coped from the ssh client
        -ssh -i keyname.pem ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>

    Why

        -SSH gives secure remote access to the EC2 server
        -ubuntu is the default user for Ubuntu AMI

Download files from the internet directly into the server.
    cammond 
        wget -O app.zip "file url"

Step 3: Update the system
        - sudo apt update

    Why
        -Updates package information
        Prevents installation issues

Step 4: Install Nginx Web Server
        -sudo apt install nginx -y
    Why
        -Nginx serves web pages to users
        -Lightweight and fast for static websites

Step 5: Start and Enable Nginx
        -sudo systemctl start nginx
        -sudo systemctl enable nginx
    Why
        -start runs Nginx immediately
        -enable starts Nginx automatically after reboot

        or
step 3,4,5 in single code
        -sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y / =>install zip zipnginx
        -unzip file.zip


Step 6: Upload Website Files
        -From local machine
        -scp -i keyname.pem -r website/* ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:/tmp
    Why
        -Transfers website files from local system to EC2

Step 7: Move Files to Web Root
        -sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
        -sudo cp -r /tmp/* /var/www/html/
        -sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
                or
        -sudo cp-r ./path/* /var/www/html/
    Why
        -/var/www/html is Nginx default directory
        -Proper ownership avoids permission errors

Step 8: Reload Nginx
        - sudo systemctl reload nginx
    Why
        -Applies changes without stopping the server

Step 9: Access Website
        -Open browser:
        -http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
    Why
        -Public IP allows internet access to your site

If Website Is Not Opening

    Why
        -Check Security Group → HTTP (80) allowed -> shh (20)allowed
        -Check Nginx status:
        -systemctl status nginx
Verify files exist in /var/www/html 

One-Line Interview Answer
        -I hosted a static website on AWS by launching an Ubuntu EC2 instance, installing Nginx, 
        uploading website files to /var/www/html, configuring security groups, and accessing it via 
        public IP.

Interview Questions
    1. What is a static website?
    -A static website contains fixed content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and does not use server-side processing.

    2. Why use Nginx for hosting static websites?
    -Fast and lightweight
    -  Handles high traffic
    -Easy to configure
    -Low memory usage

    3. What is the default web root of Nginx in Ubuntu?
    -  /var/www/html

    4. What is the role of Security Groups in AWS?
    -Security Groups act as a virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic to EC2.

    5. Why is port 80 required?
    -Port 80 allows HTTP traffic, which is required to access websites via browser.

    6. What is wget used for?
    -wget is used to download files from the internet directly into the server.

    7. Difference between scp and wget?
    -scp	
        -Copies files from local system
        -Needs SSH
    -wget
        -Downloads files from URL
        -Needs internet

    8. How do you check if Nginx is running?
    -systemctl status nginx

    9. What happens if permissions are wrong?
    -The website may show 403 Forbidden error.

    10. Difference between static and dynamic website?
    -Static	                Dynamic
        -Fixed content	        -Content changes
        -No backend	Uses        -backend (DB, server)
        -Faster	                - Slower

Project: Hosting a Static Website on AWS using EC2 & NGINX

#Prfessional Project Explanation (What I Did)

I successfully hosted a **static website on AWS** by launching an **Ubuntu EC2 instance** and 
configuring the **NGINX web server** to serve web content over the internet.
I connected securely to the EC2 instance using **SSH**, installed and configured NGINX, uploaded
website files to the server, and deployed them in the default NGINX web root directory. I also 
configured **AWS Security Groups** to allow HTTP and SSH traffic, enabling public access to the 
website through the EC2 public IP address.

This project demonstrates my understanding of **cloud infrastructure, Linux server management, 
web server configuration, and AWS networking fundamentals**.
